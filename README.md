# Iris_Flower_Classification
This is a project done on the iris flower that aims to classify iris flowers into three species Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their physical features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The project utilizes NumPy for handling numerical computations and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Seaborn and Matplotlib support visual exploration of the dataset, providing clear insights into the relationships among features through scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps. The dataset is obtained using the load_iris function from the sklearn.datasets module, offering a clean, well-labeled collection of samples suitable for classification.
The data is divided into training and testing subsets with train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, ensuring that model evaluation is unbiased and based on unseen data. StandardScaler standardizes the feature values to ensure uniformity in scale and improving model performance.
Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model serves as the core algorithm for classification, using mathematical modeling to estimate the probability that each sample belongs to a specific iris species.
Model performance is assessed using accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report from sklearn.metrics. These evaluation metrics quantify prediction accuracy, identify misclassifications, and summarize performance in terms of precision.The model achieved a high accuracy, demonstrating that it could successfully classify iris flowers based on their features. Visual plots of the model’s results confirmed that the predicted outputs closely matched the actual labels.
Through effective integration of data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning modeling, and performance evaluation, this project demonstrates a complete predictive analytics workflow using Python’s scientific and machine learning ecosystem.
The results clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of Logistic Regression in handling multi-class classification problems and provided a strong example of applying machine learning to real-world datasets.
